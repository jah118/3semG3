#Restaurants reservation booking, a 3rd Semester-Project made by Group-3

The project, which is based on a semester project that we have chosen, will deal with ordering a table and food at various restaurants. The idea of the project is that our program should work with all restaurant's websites. More precisely, we want to make it a greater experience and co-determination of where you want to sit in the restaurant and a place you want to visit. At the same time, we will try to add that customers can also order the food in advance so that in principle they do not have to sit and decide what they should have to eat and drink when they arrive, but the kitchen may have prepared the food you want to eat. It can shorten the trip in and out for e.g. a businessman who just needs some food and wants to move on faster than a normal guest. At the same time, it can also give the restaurant an advantage for those customers who want to spend less time getting some good food. That way, they can get more customers through in one day if they have everything prepared.


## Getting Started

A step by step series that tells you what you need to do, in order to run the Wep-Api, desktop-client and web-client with a local database.
```
1. Open up all 3 Visual Studio solutions
2. In the RestaurantAPI-solution run the RestaurantUpdater project to create local db with test data,  
   A Console should appear, whit a green **succes ** - it can take a while
   then close it.
3. Start the RestaurantAPI project - a browers with swagger should open up
4. Start the client of choice, as long the restaurantAPI is running both client works.
```
